# 42-formation-lvl2-7.push-swap

### _Project 7: Push Swap - Seventh project for the formation of software engineers at school 42 SÃ£o Paulo._

- This project aim to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of operations. 

## _This project was like this:_

## _The operations we can use are:_

| Operation             | Description                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sa (swap a)           | Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a                   |
| sb (swap b)           | Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b                   |
| pa (push a)           | Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a |
| pb (push b)           | Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b |
| ra (rotate a)         | Shift up all elements of stack a by 1                             |
| rb (rotate b)         | Shift up all elements of stack b by 1                             |
| rr                    | ra and rb at the same time                                        |
| rra (reverse rotate a)| Unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase)                          |
| rrb (reverse rotate b)| Shift down all elements of stack b by 1                           |
| rrr                   | rra and rrb at the same time.                                     |

## _How to test it_

To test, you should run the Make all command
  
```bash
make all
```

Now compile the executable file generated by the makefile and add the parameters you want. For example:
  
```bash
./push_swap 42 142 9123 -123 -254231278 -10470 12748 -15027 -17306 1864
```

## _Examples_

We can check stacks A and B. On the right, we can see the operation that was used.
