## _How to test it_

For you to test this project, you should use the following way:

```bash
./pipex file1 "cmd1" "cmd2" file2
```
Just in case: file1 and file2 are file names, cmd1 and cmd2 are shell commands with their parameters.

The execution of the pipex program should do the same as the next shell command:

```bash
< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
```

<b>Example 1:<b>
```bash
./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile
```
<b>Should be the same as:<b>
```bash
< infile ls -l | wc -l > outfile
```

<b>Example 2:<b>
```bash
 ./pipex infile "grep a1" "wc -w" outfile
```
<b>Should be the same as:<b>
